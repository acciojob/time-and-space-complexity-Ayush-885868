<h1>Time and Space Complexity in Data Structure</h1>
	<p>Time complexity is defined in terms of how many times it
		takes to run a given algorithm, based on the length of 
		the input we have some efficient manner to find it</p>
	<p>The amount of memory used by a program to execute it is
		represented by its <b>Space Complexity</b> and it is O(n) in some cases</p>
